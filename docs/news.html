          A new project is taking shape which involves a slow process of
          coloring fabrics in mud. The process evokes temporal conditions
          embedded in earth itself, highlighting a material presence that speaks
          of endurance, transformation, and the fragile permeability between
          natural processes and human intention. The work suggests trajectories
          both temporal and grounded, where color becomes a trace of contact
          with landscape and time.

          Amanda has extended her family by welcoming a new presence — a baby
          named Rickie. By arriving into their everyday, Rickie evokes temporal
          conditions of care and continuity, highlighting a presence that
          reflects both the fragility and durability of beginnings. This moment
          unfolds at the tender permeability between past and future,
          accompanied by subtle, temporal suggestions of the trajectories now
          opening before them.
